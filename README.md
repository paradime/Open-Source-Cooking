## Motivation

Cooking can be intimidating, especially in this day and age. It can be so
convenient to run out and purchase your calories, but creating your calories can
be rewarding, delicious, cheaper, fun, and may save your life.

One of the most important things to understand is that you can learn anything.
In fact, there's a MOOC that will teach you just that. It's the most popular and
even life changing MOOC available.
